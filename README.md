# Improve your privacy & security on smartphones

## What is DNS? 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the yellow pages of the Internet. Computers on a network need IPs addresses of the web servers. 
 
 
## Do you know what DNS service You are using?

The answer to the above is usually no.


## What’s the risk?
Ever since DNS was created in 1987, it has been largely unencrypted. Everyone between your device and the resolver is able to snoop on or even modify your DNS queries and responses. This includes anyone in your local Wi-Fi network, your Cell Service Provider, and in-transit providers (or your government). This may affect your privacy by revealing the domain you are visiting.

Imagine, you sit down in a cafe, and open your smartphone. I am sitting in the corner and I have decided I am going to learn about you. I watch your unencrypted DNS requests go to cat-memes.com and every few minutes you check out webmd.com. I can easily tell maybe that you’re sick and have a cat. A lot can be learned by watching someone’s internet usage and privacy becomes an issue from other users or your ISP (or government).
